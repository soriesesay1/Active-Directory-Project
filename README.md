What is Active Directory? This link will explain better https://www.quest.com/solutions/active-directory/what-is-active-directory.aspx

In this lab, we will learn how to set up Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team as part of this Active Directory project (home lab). We will also look at how a domain environment works and how to send events logs to our Splunk (SIEM) and make data about attacks seen in the wild to help you find them. This home lab has 5 parts.
