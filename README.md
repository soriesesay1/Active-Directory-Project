What is Active Directory? This link will explain better https://www.quest.com/solutions/active-directory/what-is-active-directory.aspx

In this lab, we will learn how to set up Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team as part of this Active Directory project (home lab). We will also look at how a domain environment works and how to send events logs to our Splunk (SIEM) and make data about attacks seen in the wild to help you find them. This home lab has 5 parts.

# Part 1:
We learn how to draw the diagram for our lab (project) using a site name draw.io and below is the outcome.

For the Hardware, it depends to how many gigs you have in your laptop and as for me I have 32.
